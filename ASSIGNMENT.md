# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned the library by whiteboarding and diagraming the functions and how they led into each other. The examples that came with the library where also helpful to look at and made it easier to understand. One change that I would have made to the code
> is the formatting of some of the code as it wasn't the best.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> I would say that raising the level of abstraction means to generalize what the code does. While two pieces of code may do the same thing they may go about it in different ways. They would both of the same level of abstraction but different specifics. 
> I would tell the student to focus more on the what not the how.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> I spent about 10 hours on this assignment

##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I talked about the hw with isabelly and marissa


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> None!
